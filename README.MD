> **"Reclaiming the world's data layer through Decentralized Spatial Intelligence."**

Sovereign Map is a high-fidelity spatial operating system and geopolitical analyst dashboard. It reclaims the spatial commons by merging real-time **ORB-SLAM3** visual tracking with **Google Gemini AI** powered geopolitical intelligence, all anchored to the **Polygon AggLayer** for cryptographic finality.

🗺️ Sovereign Map: Federated Learning Orchestration (Alpha Genesis)
Sovereign Map is a decentralized physical infrastructure network (DePIN) designed for privacy-preserving spatial intelligence. 
This repository contains the "Alpha Genesis" demo code, demonstrating the core hardware-software co-design for federated learning on heterogeneous edge devices. 

🏗️ Core Architecture

The system utilizes a hierarchical federated learning approach, offloading compute to the edge while maintaining data residency. 

NPU Acceleration: Utilizes LiteRT for vendor-agnostic NPU inference.

Orchestration: Implements the MOHAWK framework for dynamic node community selection.

Privacy Guardrails: Homomorphic encryption and differential privacy integrated into the gradient aggregation layer. 

🚀 Getting Started (Investor Demo)

To verify the performance of local inference on NPU-enabled devices:

Clone the Repository: git clone https://github.com/rwilliamspbg-ops/Sovereign_Map_Federated_Learning

Install Dependencies: Follow the simplified Installation Guide using Python 3.11+.

Run Alpha Genesis Demo: Execute python scripts/alpha_genesis_pilot.py to initiate a local training loop.


🛠️ Tech Stack

Core: Python, C++

ML Engines: LiteRT, PyTorch Edge

Infrastructure: IPFS (Storage), MQTT (Messaging)

Massive Addressable Market: AI spending is projected to reach $2 trillion in 2026. The DePIN market cap is currently estimated between $10 billion and $33 billion.

Scalable Revenue Projections: Analysts forecast DePIN protocols will generate over $100 million in on-chain verifiable revenue by the end of 2026.

Privacy-First Architecture: Sovereign Map's focus on Sovereign AI aligns with global trends where governments (e.g., Canada) are making strategic investments in public and commercial AI infrastructure.

Battle-Tested Roadmap: The existence of initial demo code de-risks the project for 2026 VCs who are wary of "pilot purgatory" and favor execution-ready infrastructure.

Technical Proof: Our architecture utilizes homomorphic encryption and decentralized authentication to ensure local data never leaves the node, solving the primary legal barrier to global AI data sharing.
