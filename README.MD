# SovereignMap: Byzantine-Robust Federated Learning

SovereignMap is a proof-of-concept (POC) for a decentralized Federated Learning (FL) network. It features a stake-weighted aggregation system designed to resist Byzantine (malicious) attacks while providing a real-time monitoring HUD.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
* **Docker & Docker Compose**
* **Python 3.9+** (for local testing)
* **Node.js & npm** (for frontend development)

### Deployment
The easiest way to launch the full stack (Aggregator, Nodes, and Dashboard) is using the provided start script:
```bash
chmod +x start.sh
./start.sh
