> **"Reclaiming the world's data layer through Decentralized Spatial Intelligence."**

Sovereign Map is a high-fidelity spatial operating system and geopolitical analyst dashboard. It reclaims the spatial commons by merging real-time **ORB-SLAM3** visual tracking with **Google Gemini AI** powered geopolitical intelligence, all anchored to the **Polygon AggLayer** for cryptographic finality.

Sovereign-Map

Sovereign-Map is an open-source, privacy-first geospatial visualization engine designed to empower organizations with full ownership over their mapping stack. By decoupling the map interface from proprietary data providers, Sovereign-Map ensures that sensitive spatial data remains secure, auditable, and locally controlled.

🚀 Core Features

Self-Sovereign Data Layer: Native support for local GeoJSON, TopoJSON, and PostGIS integration.

High-Performance Rendering: Utilizing WebGL-based rendering for smooth interaction with thousands of map polygons and points.

Dynamic Styling Engine: A CSS-like styling framework for geospatial features based on attribute metadata.

Offline Capability: Designed to operate in low-bandwidth or disconnected environments using cached vector tiles.

Custom Projection Support: Go beyond standard Web Mercator to support specialized coordinate reference systems (CRS).

🛠 Technical Architecture

The codebase is organized into three primary modules:

Core Engine: The central logic handling the map lifecycle, zoom/pan interactions, and layer stacking.

Data Provider API: A standardized interface for connecting to various data sources (Flat files, SQL databases, or decentralized storage).

UI/UX Component Library: A set of React-based components for custom overlays, legends, and spatial querying tools.
