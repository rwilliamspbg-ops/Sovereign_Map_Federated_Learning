    Key Layer Explanations (Concise)Edge Layer — Physical devices + university founders kickstart the network.
Networking Layer — Gossip-based P2P forms resilient mesh with low-latency global connectivity.
AI Layer — Gemini inference + federated learning (FedMUD compressed) for edge intelligence.
Governance Layer — ANO + DAO + staking creates self-adaptive, incentive-aligned rules.
Infrastructure Layer — CXL 3.2 pooling + TSP security + K8s deployment + observability.
Client Layer — React app delivers immersive HUD and voice interaction to end users.

Quick Facts from the DiagramScalability: Designed for 10M+ nodes with percolation at ~0.7%.
Security: TSP enclaves + Byzantine tolerance up to 40%.
Efficiency: CXL 3.2 tiering → 3–6% latency reduction, 50%+ memory savings.
Growth: 1,000 founders → 10M nodes in ~3.5–4 years (faster than Bitcoin/Ethereum).
Sustainability: Self-funding by year 2–3 via staking + spatial data markets.
